 <h1>Machine learning</h1>
 <p>Machine learning is a field of <u>computer science </u>that gives computers the ability to 
 learn without being explicitly programmed.</p>
 
 
 <p><b><i>Machine learning</i></b> is closely related to (and often overlaps with) computational statistics, 
 which also focuses on prediction-making through the use of computers. </p>
 </div>
 
 
 <p>Machine learning is sometimes conflated with <u><b>data mining</b><u>, where the latter subfield focuses more on 
 exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learning.:vii Machine learning can also be 
 unsupervised and be used to learn and establish baseline behavioral profiles for various entities
 and then used to find meaningful anomalies.</p>  
 

<p>Here are a few widely publicized examples of machine learning applications you may be familiar with:</p>
<ul>
<div>
<li>The heavily hyped, self-driving Google car The essence of machine learning.</li>
<li>Online recommendation offers such as those from <u><i>Amazon and Netflix Machine learning</i></u> applications for 
everyday life.</li>
</div>
<li>Knowing what customers are saying about you on Twitter? Machine learning combined with linguistic rule creation.</li>
<li>Fraud detection? One of the more obvious, important uses in our world today.</li>
</ul>
